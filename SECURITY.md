# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The project's team and community take security issues.

We appreciate your efforts to disclose your findings responsibly and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, go to the project's issues and create a new issue using the ⚠️ Security Report 'issue template' on the [Issues tab](../issues).

We'll endeavour to respond quickly and keep you updated throughout the process.
